			<h2>A Glimpse Into My Background</h2>

			<p>
				Since I was a child, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by how things work. Whenever something broke, I would analyze it and
				figure out how to fix it. No toy or device escaped my handsâ€” I even took apart my grandmotherâ€™s TV! ðŸ«£
			</p>
			<p>
				With the same motivation and curiosity, I completed my studies in Electronics at a technical school, where I
				expanded my practical skills in the real world. Years later, at university, I chose to pursue a path closer to
				the humanities, first studying Communication and then Psychology. These disciplines helped me hone my
				communication, resilience, active listening, and empathy skillsâ€”tools I continue to apply in both my personal
				and professional life.
			</p>
			<p>
				Almost a year after finishing university, I decided to move to Germany, where I worked as a Spanish teacher.
				This role allowed me to leverage my teaching skills while developing new ones, such as adapting to new
				environments, working in multidisciplinary teams, and planning. It also gave me the chance to connect with
				people from various backgrounds and cultures, and to understand different approaches to problem-solving and
				collaborative work.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, my passion for technology never faded, so I decided to change my professional path and focus on web
				development. In 2023, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the world of programming as a technical support
				engineer, where I learned, among many other skills, to understand user needs and expectations. This is crucial
				for creating web applications that truly make a difference.
			</p>
			<p>
				In my role as a technical support engineer, I also encountered stressful situations, such as resolving urgent
				problems under pressure. However, Iâ€™ve grown accustomed to handling them calmly and effectively, communicating
				clearly and proactively with the team to find quick solutions and keep everything under control.
