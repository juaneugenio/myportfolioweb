			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
				Here I mainly present my <strong> work and educational </strong>biography. But quickly, let me tell you a bit
				more about myself.
			</p>
			<p>
				Ever since I was a kid, Iâ€™ve always been fascinated by taking things apart and putting them back together to
				understand how they work. I remember my friends and neighbors often came to me to have their gadgets fixed.
			</p>
			<p>
				I finished high school with a degree in electronics, but also studied electricity, mechanics and carpentry. I
				really enjoyed the practical technical projects, although this required knowledge of mathematics, chemistry and
				physics too. However, in college I decided to strengthen my human skills by studying communication and
				psychology.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of 2006, I visited Germany for a few weeks and fell in love with the country. So I decided to move
				there a year later, aware of the cultural, professional and linguistic challenges ahead. Since then, I have
				enjoyed working as a Spanish teacher in several Bavarian public and private institutions.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, with the advances in current technology, I think itâ€™s time to revisit my technical roots, which have
				always been part of me. Iâ€™m sure software development is the right way for me.
			</p>
