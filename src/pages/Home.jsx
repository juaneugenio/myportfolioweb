				<p>
					My journey as a developer began back in 2021, when I dived into the exciting realm of the Javascript MERN
					stack. Since then, I have been constantly improving my functional and Obejct-oriented programming skills,
					focusing on projects with ReactJS and responsive web design. On the backend, I'm comfortable with Express,
					Node, MongoDB, REST API and server-side rendering.
				</p>
				<p>
					But technical knowledge alone is not enough, is it? During my career as a Spanish teacher, I developed the
					ability to listen carefully to the learning needs of my students and to offer effective solutions to the
					challenges they face in their learning process. <br /> I am confident that the combination of my technical and
					interpersonal skills will help me to work effectively with both clients and development teams.
				</p>
				<p>
					My immediate goal as a career move is to secure a full-time position in web development, ideally within a
					dynamic team that appreciates my communication, analytical and problem-solving skills. <br />
					If you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact me to provide you with more information on how my
					qualifications can have a valuable impact on your organisation.
